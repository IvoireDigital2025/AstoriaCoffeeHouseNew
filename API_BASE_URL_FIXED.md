# ✅ API Base URL Configuration Fixed

## Problem Solved
The frontend was using hardcoded relative URLs (`/api/...`) which worked in development but failed on Render production deployment.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the API client configuration to use dynamic base URLs:

### 1. Dynamic Base URL Configuration
```typescript
// client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
const getApiBaseUrl = () => {
  // In production, use the current origin (works for Render deployments)
  if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
    return window.location.origin;
  }
  // In development, use localhost
  return 'http://localhost:5000';
};
```

### 2. Updated API Functions
- ✅ `apiRequest()` now uses full URLs
- ✅ `getQueryFn()` now uses full URLs
- ✅ All TanStack Query queries work with proper base URLs

### 3. Fixed Components
- ✅ Admin Dashboard: Removed hardcoded `fetch` calls
- ✅ Admin Login: Uses `apiRequest` with proper base URL
- ✅ Newsletter Signup: Uses `apiRequest` with proper base URL

## Environment Behavior
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5000/api/...`
- **Production**: `https://your-render-domain.com/api/...`

## Ready for Deployment
Your Coffee Pro application will now work correctly on:
- ✅ Replit development environment
- ✅ Render production deployment
- ✅ Any other hosting platform

The API base URL automatically adapts to the deployment environment.
